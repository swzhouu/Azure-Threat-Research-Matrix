# AZT607 - Extract Azure Load Testing Secrets and Tokens

> Note: **AZT607** is a placeholder family ID for this proposal. Maintainers may renumber or relocate this entry.

An adversary with write access to an **Azure Load Testing** resource can configure/load test scripts (JMeter **JMX** or **Locust** Python) that execute code within the Load Testing worker. This execution context can access:

- **Managed Identity** (MI) metadata endpoint to obtain access tokens for the Load Testing resourceâ€™s assigned identity.
- **Secrets and certificates** that Azure Load Testing injects for test runs (secrets as **environment variables**; certificates on disk for the test runner).

With code execution in the test plan, an attacker can enumerate and exfiltrate these values from the worker and impersonate identities or access downstream resources authorized by those credentials.

ID | Name | Description | Action | Resources
---|---|---|---|---
AZT607.1 | JMeter/Locust Code Execution to Extract Secrets/Tokens | Abuse JMX JSR223/BeanShell or Locust Python to run code, enumerate environment variables and certificate files, and query IMDS for MI tokens during Azure Load Testing runs. | N/A (test plan execution) | Azure Load Testing
