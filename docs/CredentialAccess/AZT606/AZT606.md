# AZT606 - Steal App Service Easy Auth Tokens

> Note: **AZT606** is a placeholder family ID for this proposal. The maintainers may renumber or relocate this entry during review.

An adversary may obtain user tokens from Azure App Service’s built-in Authentication/Authorization (“Easy Auth”) token cache. When Easy Auth is enabled, user tokens (ID, access, and optionally refresh tokens) can be cached by the middleware and stored on the App Service filesystem (default) or in a configured external store. If an attacker can read the token store and the corresponding encryption material, they can decrypt tokens and impersonate users against downstream APIs or the application itself.

AZT606.1 | App Service Token File Decryption (Kudu) | Use Kudu/SCM command execution or APIs to read Easy Auth token files from the App Service filesystem, retrieve the encryption key from environment/app settings, and decrypt the tokens. | N/A (SCM/Kudu HTTP APIs) | App Service
